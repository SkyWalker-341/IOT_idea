# AI-Driven IoT-Based Ocean Safety and Fish Detection System

## Project Overview
This IoT project focuses on solving two critical problems faced by fishermen:
1. **Fish Detection & Size Estimation** - Helping fishermen locate and catch the right-sized fish using ultrasonic and thermal imaging sensors.
2. **Weather & Ocean Current Prediction** - Providing real-time alerts about dangerous ocean currents and weather changes to prevent accidents.

The system integrates **IoT sensors, AI-based processing, and real-time communication** to improve safety and optimize fishing efficiency.

## Workflow & How It Works
### 1. **Fish Detection & Size Estimation**
- **Sensors Used**: Ultrasonic sensors detect fish underwater, and thermal cameras estimate fish size.
- **AI Processing**: A machine learning model processes the captured data to classify fish species and determine their size.
- **Data Transmission**: The system sends fish detection reports to fishermen via a mobile app or IoT dashboard.

### 2. **Weather & Ocean Current Prediction**
- **Sensors Used**: Climate sensors (temperature, humidity, wind speed) and ocean current sensors monitor real-time conditions.
- **AI Model**: The system analyzes historical and real-time data to predict dangerous weather patterns and ocean currents.
- **Alert System**: If unsafe conditions are detected, the system sends alerts to fishermen and the coast guard.

### 3. **Real-Time Communication**
- **Fishermen Alerts**: IoT-enabled mobile notifications, SMS alerts, or beacon light indicators.
- **Emergency Messaging**: If conditions become critical, an automatic distress signal with GPS location is sent to the coast guard.

## Simple Example to Understand the Concept
### **Scenario 1: Fish Detection & Size Estimation**
- A fisherman places an IoT device in the ocean.
- The ultrasonic sensor detects a large school of fish.
- The thermal camera captures fish size, and AI determines they are legally catchable.
- The system alerts the fisherman to the exact location, saving time and fuel.

### **Scenario 2: Weather & Ocean Safety Alert**
- The fisherman is out at sea, and the system continuously monitors weather conditions.
- AI detects a sudden temperature drop and a shift in ocean currents, indicating a storm is forming.
- The system sends an early warning to the fisherman and notifies the coast guard.
- The fisherman returns safely before conditions worsen.

## Real-Life Problems Solved
### **1. Reducing Fishermenâ€™s Risk at Sea**
- Provides early warnings about storms, high tides, and dangerous ocean currents.
- Reduces the number of accidents caused by unpredictable weather changes.

### **2. Improving Fishing Efficiency and Sustainability**
- Guides fishermen to locations where large fish are present, reducing time and effort.
- Prevents overfishing by ensuring only the right-sized fish are caught.
